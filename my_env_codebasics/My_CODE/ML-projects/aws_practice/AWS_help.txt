SageMaker Model Devlopment and Deployment process:
    Data creation in S3:
    create s3 objects for Train, Test and Model-deployment_Output_Path
    save train and test data to S3
    
    Model fitting using EC2:
    read the saved train and test data from s3
    build a container object from the imported AWS ML models
    initialize Hyperparameters based on the training and crossvalidation from the local computation
    construct an estimator to train and fit on training data based on the container and Model-deployment_Output_Path
    fit the estimator using train and test s3 data objects.
    
    Model deployment using EC2:
    create a deployment_Object by deploying the fitted model estimator
    predict using the deployment_Object by serializing the data
    
    Termination:
    Terminate the deployment_Object one prediction is Done by deleting The Endpoints
    After deleting the deployment_Object delet the S3 data if not need.
